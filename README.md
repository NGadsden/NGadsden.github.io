# Nick Gadsden

## I'm making a website to showcase my work and schooling experience to prove myself to possible employers better.

## I am an Eagle Scout who worked with BSA for most of my life and I was able to gain 3 extra palms. I successfully led and completed a sustainable rain collection system at my high school able to hold over 100 gallons of rain water at a time.
